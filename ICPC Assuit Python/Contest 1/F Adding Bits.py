Peter Parker had worked hard throughout his digital logic course, but when he was asked to implement a 32 bit adder for a machine,
he made a mistake in the design part. After tracing the design for half an hour, he found his flaw!! He was doing bitwise addition, but the carry bit is always zero.
4=00000000000000000000000000000100
+
6=00000000000000000000000000000110
=
2=00000000000000000000000000000010
Now, he has to write an efficient program that would take 2 unsigned 32 bit decimal numbers as input,
and reproduce the output by adding them in the same way as his circuit does.

Input
Only One line containing two decimal numbers A and B ( 0 ≤ A , B ≤ 109 ).

Output
Print the value after adding A and B in Peter Parker's way.
'''
x,y = input().split()
x,y = int(x),int(y)
print(x^y)
